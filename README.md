# OVERVIEW

This notebook was used for a presentation as a hands-on tutorial Lecture on the introduction to Machine learning for the IndabaX Nigeria 2021 conference between 24th and 25th September 2021.

## Introduction

This tutorial is used to explain the concept of Machine Learning using one of its popular algorithms, Linear Regression to solve a multi-variant regression problem.

### The Problem

The goal is to train a model to predict housing price.

The Boston housing prices dataset from [Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) was used to train and evaluate the model.


The final model has not been been deployed. You can access the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BUJ-YOAgbaHWhjS8X2Mdc3Wd3grtzuGh?usp=sharing) and run it directly on google colab.

You can also download the notebook, set up a virtual environment, install the dependencies and run it locally.
